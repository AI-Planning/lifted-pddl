"""
This class implements functionality for:
	- Parsing PDDL domains and problems
	- Obtaining the actions applicable at the init state of the corresponding problem
	- Obtaining the next state resulting from applying an action to the init state (successor function)

<Limitations>: it only supports:
				- types (as in typed STRIPS) 
				- existential preconditions
				- negative preconditions (although only negative atoms and not negative compound formulas)

	<Specification of get_applicable_actions>
	Returns the ground applicable actions at the current state (given by self.object_names, self.object_types and self.atoms)
	Applicable actions are returned as a dictionary where the key is the action name and the value
	is a list containing all the variable substitutions (groundings) which make the action applicable.

	<Description>
	The algorithm used to obtain the applicable actions is heavily inspired by Powerlifted (https://github.com/abcorrea/powerlifted).
	More specifically, by the method detailed in 'Lifted Successor Generation using Query Optimization Techniques' by Correa et al.
	We implement the 'naive join' algorithm detailed in that work directly in Python, without using any framework for query evaluation.
	The algorithm is as follows:

	1. Iterate over actions.
	2. For each action, iterate over preconditions.
	3. For each precondition:
		- Associate each atom's object with the corresponding action parameter (atom obj_ind to parameter_ind, which is the same as the variable_assignment_ind)
		- Obtain the indexes of atom's objects corresponding to bound variables in the partial variable assignments
			- This is something like "We need to compare first object of atom with third object of variable assignemnt and second object of atom with sixth object of variable assignment,
			  and they need to be equal"
		- Iterate over each atom in the problem.
		- For each atom:
			- Check if the atom's predicate is the same as the precondition's predicate
			- Check if the type of each atom's object inherits from the type of the corresponding action parameter
			- If any of these two conditions are false, we skip this atom
			- Iterate over each partial variable assignment
				- Check if the atom objects corresponding to bound variables match the objects of the partial variable assignment
				- If true, add a new variable assignment:
					- Copy the old variable assignment
					- For each atom's object, change the corresponding object of the variable assignment to it (bind new variables)
	4. Return valid (applicable) variable assignments for the action.
	"""

	"""
	Auxiliary function used by get_applicable_actions. It receives a set of variable assignments (each one with an arbitrary number of free and bind variables),
	and returns a list with all the full variable assignments obtained from them and which correspond to applicable ground actions.
	The full variable assignments are returned as a tuple of tuples.
